# RainbowMix - brings liquidity to existing NFTs based on ERC404

## Introduction
Rainbow Mix (RBM) is a pioneering ERC404 token that merges the excitement of NFT collections with the liquidity and accessibility of ERC20 tokens. At its core, RBM is a vibrant ecosystem that encapsulates a curated mix of existing Ethereum NFT collections. This innovative approach offers participants a unique opportunity to own a piece of a diverse and valuable NFT portfolio through the simplicity of an ERC20 token transaction.

## Concept
Rainbow Mix is designed to democratize access to a variety of sought-after NFT collections, making it easier for enthusiasts to participate in the NFT market without navigating the complexities of individual NFT acquisitions. Each RBM token is intricately linked to a specific token ID within the Rainbow Mix collection, which could potentially be any NFT from the aggregated collections.

## Key Features
Diverse NFT Collection: Rainbow Mix aggregates NFTs from multiple renowned Ethereum NFT collections, offering a rich tapestry of digital art and assets.
Token-Linked NFTs: Each purchase of an RBM token is directly tied to a unique token ID within the Rainbow Mix collection. This token ID represents a chance to own one of the NFTs from the aggregated collections.
Dynamic Collection: The Rainbow Mix collection aims to reach a milestone of 10,000 NFTs. Until this cap is reached, new NFTs will be continually added to the collection, enhancing its diversity and value.
Holding Incentive: Token holders are encouraged to hold onto their RBM tokens if their associated token ID has not yet been allocated an NFT. As the collection grows, the probability of each unallocated token ID being linked to a new NFT increases, adding excitement and anticipation to the holding experience.
Mechanism

## Token Purchase: 
Investors buy RBM tokens, with each token representing a stake in the Rainbow Mix NFT collection.
Token-NFT Linkage: The underlying smart contract assigns each RBM token a unique token ID that has the potential to be linked to one of the NFTs in the Rainbow Mix collection.
Collection Growth: New NFTs are periodically added to the Rainbow Mix collection until the total count reaches 10,000.
NFT Allocation: As NFTs are added, RBM tokens with previously unassigned token IDs are randomly selected to be linked to these new additions, rewarding patient holders.
Benefits
Accessibility: RBM lowers the barrier to entry for NFT enthusiasts, allowing for fractional ownership and investment in high-value NFTs.
Diversification: By holding RBM tokens, investors gain exposure to a broad range of NFT assets, mitigating the risk associated with investing in single NFTs.
Liquidity: RBM tokens offer enhanced liquidity compared to traditional NFTs, enabling holders to buy and sell tokens more freely on ERC20-compatible exchanges.
Dynamic Ownership: The continually evolving nature of the Rainbow Mix collection ensures that the ecosystem remains vibrant, with new opportunities for token holders emerging as the collection expands.
